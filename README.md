# Programming Reactive Systems

Reactive programming is a set of techniques for implementing scalable,  resilient and responsive systems as per the Reactive Manifesto. Such  systems are based on asynchronous message-passing, and their basic  building-blocks are event handlers. This course teaches how to implement reactive systems in Scala and Akka by using high-level abstractions,  such as actors, asynchronous computations, and reactive streams.
